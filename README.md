# HevlarStarter

This is a starter code for a multi-module architecture with spring boot, where the domain (business logic), api, and frontend are split into different projects.

The project is also prefilled with the necessary tests (unit, integration, e2e), ci/cd setup, semantic-release plantuml, javadoc, etc as a template to ensure project quality.
